What does the notebook do?
1. ceonvert the raw data into csv format
2. Summary of the dataset
3. Check and replace SCAT sites that have latitude/longitude 0 (see cell 4)
4. Look for SCAT that has less than 31 days of data
5. Oversampling the dataset to let every SCAT have 31 days of data
6. Look for how many location does a SCAT site
7. Change the full dataset into a format of:
   <SCAT> <location> ........ <Date/time> <count>
8. Split the full dataset into having each SCAT/location as a individual CSV file
